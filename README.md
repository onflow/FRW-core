# Flow Wallet Shared TypeScript Packages

This repository will be the future home for shared TypeScript packages used by the Flow Wallet Extension and mobile applications.

For now, these shared packages are still hosted in the main extension repository. You can find them here:

[Flow Wallet Extension Repository](https://github.com/onflow/FRW-Extension)

Stay tuned for updates as we migrate and centralize shared code in this repository.
